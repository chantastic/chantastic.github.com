We use the word cancer a lot now.

I dont remember using the word much before—save for frequent self-diagnosis on WebMD.

When cancer is in your kid, it feels like you got two kids but in a Jekyll and Hyde type configuration.  Most days she's a normal infant, discovering the world and pawing at her tongue like arangatang on ecstacy.  But once a month, you see the pictures, and it's unmistakeable—she has a Hyde in waiting.

I've been reluctant to write about it.  I havent had much to say.  But a year in, I'm starting to.  Ruby has cancer.  It sits in the center of her right eye and lives in ever cell she creates.
